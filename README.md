# Analysis of SNAP chain retailers in Atlanta during the Great Recession

This repo contains data and analysis scripts for an analysis of changing access to chain SNAP retailers in the metro Atlanta area during the Great Recession. This analysis was largely conducted in R, though some visualization was done in ArcMap. Scripts and data from the R analysis are included here. 

There are three main analysis files:
* StoreDistanceRasters contains the commands used to calculate distance to each chain in each year of our analysis.
* StoreAnalysis_DemogClusters_tract contains the commands used to create demographic clusters of tracts in our study area and run descriptive analysis on store distance.
* store_distance_analysis contains commands used for correlation and our fixed effects models.

For our modeling/correlation, the main dataset used was the storedist_tct_data_2017_07_14 csv file in the Data folder.
